## Getting Started

1.Install dependencies
`npm install`

2.Start Webpack Development Server
`npm serve`

3.Open App
Hot Module Reloading: http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/
Refresh Manually: http://localhost:8080


## Distribution Build
The dist build output is the dist/ directory, you can open the index.html file
there, but it will not feature hot module reloading like the dev server configuration does

`npm build`
